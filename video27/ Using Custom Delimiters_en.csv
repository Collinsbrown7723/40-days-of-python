In the last two lectures, I've shown you how to read and write

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,360
typical csv files where the field delimiter is a comma.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,070
There are cases where another delimiter is used.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,570
For example, a colon a tab or any other character can be used as a delimiter.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:30,100
The reader and writer functions of csv module are very flexible; we can pass in as arguments some

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,820
parameters that define the structure of the csv file.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,020
Let me show you an example!

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,620
I 'll read a the file where the colon is used as the limiter.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:51,800
In fact, this is the passwd file from any Linux distribution where all user and system accounts 

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,630
are saved.

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,980
After importing the csv module I'll open the file in read only mode.

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,040
passwd 

13
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,400
The name of the file is without .csv extension but there is no problem and it is in the

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,860
same directory with my Python script.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:27,350
It will be opened in read-only mode as f: now reader=csv.reader

16
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,740
the file object and the second argument is the delimiter.

17
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,200
So delimiter=':'

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,900
This will be the delimiter.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,230
I can pass in also other arguments, for example lineterminator=='\n'

20
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,170
and I'll iterate over the reader object for row in reader:print(row)

21
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,720
Now I will execute this script and this is the content of my file.

22
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,100
We can see how it parsed and read the file successfully.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,800
Each line of the file is a list and each field is a list item.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:37,190
This is how we read csv files where another delimiter is used. In the next lecture

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,330
I'll show you how to use csv dialects! See you in just a few seconds!
